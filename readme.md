# exchange-rates-rba

>  Get currency exchange rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia

Retrieves exchange rates from the [Reserve Bank of Australia's exchange rate datasets](https://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/historical-data.html#exchange-rates). Base currency is always AUD.

All datasets are cached after being downloaded for quick retrieval, and each dataset covers multiple years. Exchange rate data goes back to December 1983. A maximum of 11 datasets will be downloaded, totalling about 6MB. 

Some currencies are not available through the entire 1983 â€“ current datasets, double check RBA datasets for if the specified currency is available throughout the required period. USD is available for the entire dataset period, excluding non-business days.

## Install

```sh
npm install exchange-rates-rba
```
